I﻿ charge between **£55** and **£60** per session. If we meet online, the cost is £55 per 60 minute session. I usually work using software called VSee. *(You can access this from your browser without having to download anything, and the VSee platform is confidential).*

I﻿f we meet in person, in a counselling room in Brighton, the cost is £60 for 50-60 minutes. I try to offer a full 60 minute session whenever possible, but sometimes room bookings by the hour effectively means a 50 minute-or-so hour. I'm also open to a longer session of 75 minutes for the additional cost of an extra half hour of room booking (£11).

*I can also offer longer sessions, eg 1.5 hours, both online or in-person, if this would suit you better - the cost of this is negotiable between us.*
