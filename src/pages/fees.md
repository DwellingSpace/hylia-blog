I﻿ charge between **£55** (online) and **£60** (in person) per session. 

I﻿ aim to offer full hour (60 minute) sessions. This is possible online and at Unique Mind Therapy Rooms (address below). With Hove Therapy Rooms and Portland Road rooms, I may only be able to offer 50-53 minute sessions due to needing to vacate the room for the next counsellor & client. 

H﻿owever, I'm open to a longer session of 75 minutes for the additional room booking cost (£5.50 at Hove Therapy Rooms, £9 at 148 Portland Road).

I﻿f we meet online, I use software called VSee. *(You can access this from your browser without having to download anything, and the VSee platform is completely confidential).*

*I can also offer **longer sessions, eg 1.5 or 2 hours**, both online or in-person, if this would suit you better - the cost of this is negotiable between us.*

S﻿essions are payable, in advance, via bank transfer, or at the beginning of the session if we meet in person (cash or cheque as I don't have a card reader).
