You're probably reading this section to know a bit more about how I work and what to expect if you make contact with me to arrange a session or initial chat. I work in Brighton (and previously in London) and if you search in a directory or on google or googlemaps etc, there are just so many counsellors, how do you choose?

A﻿nd perhaps you've looked at my photo and thought she looks friendly, warm... maybe she might be a possible counsellor for me?

S﻿o this website is a work in progress to hopefully give you a good idea of how I see counselling, how I work, and how I understand counselling to help people.

M﻿y core training was in the person-centred approach, developed in the 1940s and 1950s by Carl Rogers, in Chicago, USA. 

C﻿arl Rogers made some important discoveries, learning from some key people around him as he developed his counselling approach. 

Firstly, he felt that people had, within themselves, what they needed in order to grow, to change, to move in a positive direction (whatever that meant for each individual person).

S﻿econdly, that meant that he didn't need to tell people what they should do or what their difficulty was. He understood that if he was focussed on the person, willing to understand what they were conveying to him, and putting himself as far as possible into their shoes, the client themselves would move in a direction that was helpful for them.

T﻿hirdly, he understood that people feel anxiety and shame about their issues and about themselves. Therefore he developed a very empathic, very accepting way of being with clients, so they could bring whatever they needed to talk about to the counselling relationship.

It began to occur to me that unless I had a need to demonstrate my own cleverness and learning, I would do better to rely upon the client for the direction of movement in the process
