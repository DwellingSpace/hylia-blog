I﻿ bring various ways of helping you get in touch with what you need to in order to experience healing and change in your life and in yourself. For example inner criticism and self-sabotage, repeating patterns, stuck experiences like depression, and healing from anxiety.

M﻿y own experience is of a lot of depression and stuckness in my life, and low self-esteem and problems in working and going forwards in life. Yes, I functioned, I had some good times, but I also just felt stuck and suffered from bouts of depression. Which I just managed, but it wasn't really living or living in any way fully.

S﻿o, I had a lot of talking therapy - both psychodynamic (even lying on the couch) and later person-centred (the method of therapy I trained in to become a professional counsellor). However, looking back, although it was good to talk through my stuff with a caring other person, and I experienced some change, or maybe felt less alone and weird, and perhaps put my issues into perspective, what I didn't experience, looking back, was more fundamental, helpful, real change.

I﻿t was only when I discovered and learnt FOCUSING, and found both a counsellor who knew how to work this way, as well as peers to have as focusing partners - to do focusing for free with - that things began to really shift and change for me, and I went on a journey to really understand what had affected me - mostly as a child and teenager in my family - and led to so much depression and stuckness. 

S﻿o.... focusing was journey into a sort of hidden world. Hidden because in talk therapy it is very easy - and I did this myself for a looong time - it is very easy to talk about our issues, difficulties, how we feel about ourselves, what we want to, but seem unable to, change etc etc. What we don't do, because we don't know HOW to do, is to go to this kind of 'other' or 'hidden' layers of experience. Freud called it the unconsious, but Gendlin, who discovered and originated 'focusing' felt that it wasn't unconscious as such, but was in what we might call a different form. And here we get to non verbal and symbolising and implicit. Let me explain.....

A﻿nd ways of accessing this level.....

S﻿o focusing, often it is taught as going to the body. But what does that mean for most people? We have our feelings, might notice where we feel anxiety, anger, frustration, grief, sadness, longing, hopelessness. These things are FELT. But what we tend to do is to think these feelings are sort of fixed - yes, I feel pretty hopeless about my life/things changing. Yep, hopeless, can locate that as a heavy feeling in/on my chest... or yeah, in my belly, like a heavy sinking feeling, like a stone. (Sometimes this is pretty advanced stuff, EXP level....). But kind of, that's it.

B﻿ut what if we saw this as not fixed, just there and that's it, but as something that can move, change, as a process. (Maybe all you need is move, change - and help you). 



S﻿o how do you do that?

M﻿y experience as a counsellor is that some people find focusing - either feeling something in the body or getting an image or a sense of something somewhere - comes fairly naturally. For others it is a strange thing to ask them to do, eg 'where do you feel that?'.  So... I have developed creative ways of accessing this other level of experience (and neuroscience and trauma we now know that body and right brain and left brain talking about - not much change). Basically because it makes things easier.



S﻿o what follows is various ways you can try out in the counselling room (or online).
