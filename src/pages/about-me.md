 ﻿I'm a qualified person-centred counsellor, training at City Lit in London between 2012 and 2016. I am also a focusing practitioner with the [British Focusing Association](http://www.focusing.org.uk/member-profile/alisonthorpe). 

I﻿ am accredited with the [National Counselling Society](https://nationalcounsellingsociety.org/counsellors/ncs19-08005) and abide by their ethical practice and guidelines for good counselling and therapy.

Y﻿ou can have counselling sessions with me, and you can also come and learn focusing with me or book a focusing session to see what it's all about.

I﻿ charge between £50 and £60 per session. If we meet over Zoom or Skype etc, then the cost is £50 per 60 minute session. If we meet in-person, in a counselling room in Brighton, the cost is £55 or £60. I currently work at 2 different venues - [148 Portland Road, Hove, BN3 5QL](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/148+Portland+Rd,+Hove+BN3+5QL/@50.8331519,-0.1872639,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48759ab2e8763eed:0x392d32e02d282b9b!8m2!3d50.8331519!4d-0.1850699), and [69 Church Street, Hove, BN3 2BB](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/69+Church+St,+Brighton+BN1+1RL/@50.8249565,-0.1444022,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48758574b3c2919b:0xc22039a4d2b7985!8m2!3d50.8249565!4d-0.1422082).
I﻿t is £55 at 148 Portland and £60 at 69 Church Street.
