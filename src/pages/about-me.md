 ﻿I'm a qualified person-centred counsellor, I trained at City Lit in London between 2012 and 2016. I am also a focusing practitioner with the [British Focusing Association](http://www.focusing.org.uk/member-profile/alisonthorpe) and have been supporting people with focusing since 2011.

I﻿ am accredited with the [National Counselling Society](https://nationalcounsellingsociety.org/counsellors/ncs19-08005) and abide by their ethical practice and guidelines for good counselling and therapy.

Y﻿ou can have counselling sessions with me, and you can also come and learn focusing with me or book a focusing session to see what it's all about.

*﻿*What I charge for sessions**

I﻿ charge between £50 and £55 per session. If we meet over Zoom or Skype etc, then the cost is £50 per 60 minute session. If we meet in-person, in a counselling room in Brighton, the cost is £55 for 50 minutes. (I can also offer longer sessions, eg 1.5 hours, both online or in-person, if this would suit you better - the cost of this is negotiable between us).

*﻿*For focusing sessions** this is £45 online and £50 in person (BN3 5QL).

I currently work at [148 Portland Road, Hove, BN3 5QL](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/148+Portland+Rd,+Hove+BN3+5QL/@50.8331519,-0.1872639,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48759ab2e8763eed:0x392d32e02d282b9b!8m2!3d50.8331519!4d-0.1850699), and [69 Church Street, Hove, BN3 2BB](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Hove+Therapy+Rooms/@50.8274527,-0.169047,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x4875856db4be2211:0xbd3df7230b051ce2!4m5!3m4!1s0x48758546d7924da7:0x1954ff1ba24dc6ce!8m2!3d50.8274493!4d-0.1668583). 


Y﻿ou are very welcome to talk with me about what you would like at this point in your life. I'm happy to answer any questions you have about counselling with me and about focusing.

A﻿lthough I am a qualified counsellor, I also work in other ways - you could have a more **coaching** style of working with me, or you can have **guided focusing sessions**I will be adding a video to this site soon to show what focusing can look like.

W﻿ith counselling, some regularity of sessions is helpful for us both. Some people, sometimes for financial reasons, have sessions every 2 weeks with me. I think a longer gap than 2 weeks between sessions can make it harder to have continuity in the work together so I prefer either weekly or bi-weekly. You can also have sessions twice a week if you need - for example to get you through a crisis
