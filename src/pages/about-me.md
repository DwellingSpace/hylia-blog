I'm a qualified person-centred counsellor, I trained at City Lit in London between 2012 and 2016. I am also a focusing practitioner with the [British Focusing Association](http://www.focusing.org.uk/member-profile/alisonthorpe) and have been supporting people with focusing since 2011.

I﻿ am accredited with the [National Counselling Society](https://nationalcounsellingsociety.org/counsellors/ncs19-08005) and abide by their ethical practice and guidelines for good counselling and therapy.

I﻿ can work with you as your counsellor, but there are other ways that we can work. 

F﻿or example we can work in a more coaching style - eg exploring a specific goal you would like to achieve (eg more confident at work or overcoming a block) or I can provide a guided Focusing session (is like meditation but turning your attention to your experiencing in the current moment. This might be sensations in your body, the emotional 'feel' of an issue in your life, or going with what comes - imagery for example). 

I﻿ am also training to be a Clean Language coach and faciltator. This is a fascinating approach where metaphors and sometimes imagery (if you are a visual person) comes as part of a guided process which brings an answer to your desired outcome or something that you want to understand better (in yourself or a situation in your life).

I﻿ am also offering Clean Language with Focusing as a way of bringing profound and deep change to stuck and unresolved or repeating issues that you've not been able to solve or make headway with before, either by yourself or from previous counselling, coaching or personal development practices.





**What I charge for sessions**

I﻿ charge between £55 and £60 per session. If we meet online, the cost is £55 per 60 minute session. I usually work using software called VSee. *(You can access this from your browser without having to download anything, and the VSee platform is confidential).*

I﻿f we meet in person, in a counselling room in Brighton, the cost is £60 for 50-60 minutes. I try to offer a full 60 minute session whenever possible, but sometimes room bookings by the hour effectively means a 50 minute-or-so hour.

(*I can also offer longer sessions, eg 1.5 hours, both online or in-person, if this would suit you better - the cost of this is negotiable between us*). I'm also open to a longer session of 75 minutes for the additional cost of an extra half hour of room booking (£11).

I﻿ currently work from these locations:

Y﻿ou are very welcome to talk with me about what you would like at this point in your life. I'm happy to answer any questions you have about counselling with me and about focusing.

A﻿lthough I am a qualified counsellor, I also work in other ways - you could have a more **coaching** style of working with me, or you can have **guided focusing sessions.** I will be adding a video to this site soon to show what focusing can look like.

W﻿ith counselling, some regularity of sessions is helpful for us both. Some people, sometimes for financial reasons, have sessions every 2 weeks with me. I think a longer gap than 2 weeks between sessions can make it harder to have continuity in the work together so I prefer either weekly or bi-weekly. You can also have sessions twice a week if you need - for example to get you through a crisis
