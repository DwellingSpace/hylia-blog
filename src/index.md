W﻿elcome to my website. 

I﻿'m a counsellor working online and in-person in Brighton and Hove. I also work in other ways - for example coaching and offering guided Focusing sessions for deep change [see here](/pages/about-me).

My aim is to provide plenty of information, via blog posts and videos, so you can get a good idea of how I work and how we might work together if you decide to come and have a session with me.
I﻿ will also be writing about trauma and how therapy works.

Y﻿ou can either go straight ahead and book a session with me - online or in-person - or you're welcome to have an initial 20 minute Zoom or phone call (no charge). You can ask questions and say a little bit about what you'd like to explore in sessions).

Please **[email me](mailto:dwellingspacecounselling@gmail.com)** or call/text:  **0772 803 6688**

F﻿or information about what I charge for sessions, and where I'm located [see here](/pages/about-me) and [here.](/pages/fees)

B﻿elow are some blog posts about counselling and focusing and other subjects. 

W﻿ELCOME VIDEO - IN PROGRESS....
