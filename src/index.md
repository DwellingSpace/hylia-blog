W﻿elcome. I work online and in-person in counselling rooms in **Brighton, UK.**

S﻿ome more text to come here, a little bit about how I work and that I am writing blog posts about counselling, focusing, how therapy works and so on.

S﻿o I could write a lot in here - look at what I've got on dwellingspace current website that needs to be on here. I could have a map - that would be better placed in the footer if that's possible - prob have to go into the code. Ah I also need Brighton and Hove Therapy Hub link... That also needs to go in the footer. And maybe NCS logo? 

O﻿h and I am going to have artwork of how focusing, person centred counselling work, or the environment in which take place.

A﻿lso is there a way of having a post that is like pinned post on twitter?

R﻿eally I'd like a website where could have say 3 columns where have focusing, counselling and metaphor - oh and parts, working with, so maybe a grid of 4..... don't know how to do that.....(yet).
