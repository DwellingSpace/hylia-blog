W﻿elcome. I work online and in-person in counselling rooms in **Brighton, UK***.* What happens if I make this quite long - does the yellow banner get bigger to accommodate the writing? I'm going to keep going to see what happens - ooh it made it bigger I think.

I﻿ work in an experiential way - what does that mean?

Y﻿eah, well what *does* that mean?

A﻿nd yeah I'm going to have to write this section - I can use my counselling directories blurb can't I to help me and say that I'm going to be writing blog posts below and on the following pages to give you an idea of how I work and if you'd like to see what working with me is like and how it might help you :)
