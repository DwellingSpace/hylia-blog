I﻿'m a counsellor working in-person in Brighton and Hove, as well as online. As well as offering counselling, I also work in other ways - for example coaching and offering guided Focusing sessions for deep change [see here](/pages/about-me).

O﻿n my blog I will write about trauma, experiential therapy and why it is so helpful, as well as guides to coping with anxiety, procrastination, and inner criticism. This will give you an idea of how we might work together if you want to contact me to work together.

Y﻿ou can go straight ahead and book an initial session with me - online or in-person - or you're welcome to have an initial 20-30 minute Zoom/phone call (no charge). You can ask questions and say a bit about what you'd like to explore in sessions.

Please **[email me](mailto:dwellingspacecounselling@gmail.com)** or call/text:  **0772 803 6688**

F﻿or information about what I charge for sessions, and where I'm located [see here](/pages/about-me) and [here.](/pages/fees)
