Welcome to my website. My aim is to provide plenty of information so you can get a good idea of how I work and how we might work together to support you. That might be feeling better about yourself, eg moving out of depression, anxiety or feeling stuck, or making changes in your life. I am qualified as a counsellor and registered with the National Counselling Society, and as a certified Focusing Practitioner with the British Focusing Association. I am also training in a coaching approach called Clean Language. If you would like a more coaching style of working together we can explore that, or you might want counselling, or a personalised combination of both. And you are welcome to explore focusing and what this is and how it feels.

I work online and in-person in counselling rooms in **Brighton, UK**, currently mostly in Hove, but sessions can be possible more centrally in Brighton.

Please **[email me](mailto:dwellingspacecounselling@gmail.com)** or call/text:  **0772 803 6688**

F﻿or information about what I charge for sessions, and where I'm located [see here.](/pages/about-me)

T﻿he following introductory posts explain how I work and what focusing is.
