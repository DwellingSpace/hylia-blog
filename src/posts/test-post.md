> When I have been listened to and when I have been heard, I am able to re-perceive my world in a new way and to go on. It is astonishing how elements which seem insoluble become soluble when someone listens. How confusions which seem irremediable turn into relatively clear flowing streams when one is heard.

W﻿hat to cover in here:
A﻿bout making contact, what to expect (some people book a session, others introductory chat - some people asking questions via email).
I﻿ think about first session - how I work (contract which I've sent ahead), can be helpful to have why you've come/what you're hoping to get out of counselling - this can change, but can be helpful to have an idea of goals or what want to be different (can just be want to feel better and not feel so depressed, want to find some direction, feel very unmotivated).
I﻿f you've had counselling before.
A﻿nything you might want to ask me.
A﻿nything you think I should know (medication, what hasn't been helpful for you before.... can be anything).
H﻿ow & when to pay for sessions.

S﻿omething about you don't have to be prepared to say everything or give an account of yourself - I will probably ask you what is most important right now to say. Some people need to share what's going on, which is fine, other people might want to find out about me first. That is also fine.

E﻿tc.
H﻿ow long sessions - I will ask you what time signal you'd like that the session is coming to an end soon(ish). 10 mins? 5 mins? Longer? There will be a clock in the room if we are in person, if not you can probably see the time on your laptop/computer/phone - or perhaps could have some way of seeing the time if that is helpful for you.
