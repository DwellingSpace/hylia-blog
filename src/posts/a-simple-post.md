I﻿ am influenced by some different ways of working, all of which I've found extremely helpful for effecting change - within ourselves and how we are in the world:

* f﻿ocusing
* p﻿erson-centred experiential counselling
* i﻿nternal family systems and working with 'parts' of self
* w﻿orking with metaphor, imagery, symbols
