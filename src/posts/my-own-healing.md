W﻿hy do people become counsellors? It can be because we have both needed our own healing, have needed help ourselves, and we have experienced healing for ourselves. Often counsellors have difficult childhoods or other experiences that have led them into work helping others, but helping in the particular kind of way that a counsellor helps people (rather than other kinds of helpers).  

F﻿or me, my own healing has been a major part of it all.

I thought about becoming a counsellor for many many years, probably from my 20s until my late 40s when I finally started counselling training, in 2012. However, I felt so much inadequacy, that I thought (when I did consciously think about it) that I wasn't good enough, as a person, to be a counsellor. I was getting depressed on a regular basis, even if I saw this depression as milder than some people's depression. 

I﻿ got to an extremely low point in December 2010. And I decided that this life that I was living wasn't enough of a life. And I don't recall if I was suicidal or not, I think it was mainly that this life wasn't much of a life, wasn't really worth living, and that I was going to do what it took to find help, to have things change, get better, and would seek how to do that. Luckily, I knew focusing from trying to do it myself from Gendlin's book (footnote). I was very interested in it, but didn't feel that I could really get anywhere with it. I also had a baby (my third child) around this time, so it also went onto the back burner for many years. So now, well there was focusing, so maybe I'd try it. I signed up for a weekend course in February 2011.

O﻿n the Sunday afternoon - day 2 of the course - I had an experience that changed everything (write about feeling that there was GUIDANCE, inner guidance - there was something within me that knew things - the utter truth of there being no love here and needing to leave my job where I was very stressed. So the information was huge and important and the fact of contacting such a thing inside was so huge and important. I've never forgotten it.

I﻿ signed up for 5 more weekends that year. I threw myself into focusing and it provided  a lot. I learnt some crucial things, particularly disidentifying from, rather than being merged with, my issues.



W﻿hen am I going to get to what I want to write about though? About experiencing healing. It would be easy to go on from here to write about how focusing helped me, and the implicit....



A﻿nd it could be that I write this first. 



M﻿aybe if I see this as a blog... with plenty of space.... could then write about healing from trauma that is 'beyond'.



I﻿ guess there are 2 things - dissociation - and beyond.... ?
